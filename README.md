# Blog

Currently not hosted anywhere. It will be as soon as I write something of value.

## How it works

Pandoc is used to convert Markdown files from posts directory to HTML.

Beautiful Soup is used to extract post metadata, add audio to posts and generate the index page.

[Larynx](https://github.com/rhasspy/larynx) is used for text to speech.

CSS is not great atm. I'll make it better.
